## üìñ About Me
I am currently a student at Erhvervsakademi Sydvest (EASV), where I am pursuing a degree in computer science. My academic and professional interests predominantly revolve around the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and backend development, although I am genuinely fascinated by the broader spectrum of development fields. In particular, the ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence are especially captivating to me. At present, my studies are concentrated on C#, but as I delve deeper into the realm of IoT, I am starting to develop a deeper interest in C++ as well.

## üíª Technologies & Skills
Currently my studies have revolved around the following languages and most of my skills in them are represented by the bars I have placed underneath them.
